# Object-Oriented-Design-Java-Code-Samples
Coding samples from Object Oriented Design class assignments.

Class is focused on design patterns, clean and modular code, rigorous testing, and the Model-View-Controller architecture.

Assignment 2: Implement a model for the game Freecell (similar to Solitaire) based on a given Interface. Make design decisions based on future flextibility and expandability and ease of integration.

Assignment 3: Implement a controller for the Freecell model, given a controller Interface. Again, focus on making it easy to expand on in the future.

Assignemt 4: Implement a new version of a model for Freecell, where multiple cards can be moved in the same move. Ideally, easily integrate it with your first model and your controller.

Assignment 5: Design the model and all necessary Interfaces, Abstract classes, and concrete classes for an animation program. The program should model shapes on a cavas and their transformations. Focus on future expansion.

Assignment 6: Implement a textual view, an SVG view, and a Java Swing view based on the model.
